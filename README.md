# Helpdesk

# About
This project is written using the LAMP stack HTML, CSS3, jQuery, PHP, MySQL and the framework Materialize along with MaterialIcons.

The design was made from scratch no pre-existing template was used in the development of this Helpdesk, it was designed to 
be as straightforward and user friendly as possible, it was suited to be used in a company to manage internet service
orders.

This project has some of the basic features you might expect form a Helpdesk platform, There is a login page, a section to add comments, view and change the clients service orders information.

# What technologies were used
For the backend, PHP is used along with MySQL, all the PHP files can be found in the ./config directory, a few tables were created to store all the information, a SQL file has also been included

For the frontend the framework materialize was used with material icons, the design is responsive to mobile devices like tablets and smartphones.

# Conclusion
Through this project I learned a lot, I increased my knowledge using PHP and MySQL creating a full working software application. I welcome you to download the project and put on your localhost server go to the ./config/signin.php uncomment the code
create a username and password, login and explore the platform appearance and functionality.

Many thanks,
