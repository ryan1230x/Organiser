This project is written using the LAMP stack HTML, CSS3, jQuery, PHP, MySQL and the framework Materialize along with MaterialIcons.

The design was made from scratch no pre-existing template was used in the development of this Helpdesk, it was designed to 
be as straightforward and user friendly as possible, it was suited to be used in a company to manage internet service
orders.
